# Have you ever heard these phrases?

“Mondays are cursed.” “January is magic.” “Santa always shows up.” “Sell in May and go away.”
If you’ve ever heard those lines (or traded like you believed them), you’re not alone … but you might be trading a myth.

Welcome to NASDAQ’s secret calendar: where timing is everything, and the market may (or may not) have habits it can’t shake.

**So… what are we doing here?**
Think of us as your mythbusting team for stock market folklore. We’re putting seven famous “calendar effects” on trial using daily NASDAQ stock data since 1962:

- Monday effect
- January effect
- Santa Claus Rally
- Turn-of-the-Month
- Half-Month
- Halloween effect (“Sell in May”)
- Holiday effect

## How?

By digging into patterns across millions of trading days, we’ll compare returns inside each calendar window versus outside it to spot the patterns, then we’ll check if it is real by stronger statistical tests, then we will turn up the difficulty and use regressions that account for the fact that many stocks move together on the same trading day, and test robustness with controls like volatility, interest rates (Fed Funds), and inflation (CPI). Finally we want to see where they live by breaking the results down by decade and exchange to see what’s stable (and what fades).

In other words:
We start with the folklore… and keep only what survives the data.
